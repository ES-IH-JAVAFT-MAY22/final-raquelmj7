 Manos Al Dado
 

This project is a way for adults and children to have fun whenever they want, without the need to repeat the same old games or think of new ones.

It still has bugs, but I hope to fix them soon.

Some future implementations will be:
-Add user registration.
-Being able to save your finished games.
